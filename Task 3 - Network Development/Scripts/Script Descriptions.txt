audio_feature_2layer_nn.py
==========================
This script trains a simple 2 layer neural network to predict song hits from solely the spotify audio features.



embedding_distance.py
=====================
This script quickly calculates the distance between points in a network embedding.



embedding_songs.py
==================
This script creates the embeddings of individual songs given the node2vec embeddings of the artists that worked on them.



network_combine.py
==================
This script is an initial attempt at training a neural network using the network embeddings.



network_test.py
===============
This script is an initial attempt at training a neural network using the network embeddings.



preprocess_normalize.py
=======================
This script preprocesses the song embedding data by normalizing each dimension of the data.



visualization_node2vec2d.py
===========================
This script condenses a network embedding graph to two dimensions and draws it on a Matplotlib scatterplot.
