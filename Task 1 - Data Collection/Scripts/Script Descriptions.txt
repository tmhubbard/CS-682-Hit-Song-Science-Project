The scripts are named according to which portion of the Task they're related to; so, all of the "genius_***" scripts have something to do w/ scraping / validating the Genius data. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown of what each of these scripts do: 



billboard_scraper.py
====================
This script scrapes Billboard chart data for given years! 



dataset_clean.py
================
This script takes in a folder of Genius .json's, scrapes some relevant information from them (relevant to the social network, that is), and then dumps each of the new .json's into another folder. 



dataset_deduplicate.py
======================
This script takes in a folder of *cleaned* .json's (cleaned using dataset_clean.py) and then deduplicates and merges them together into one large .json 



dataset_prune.py
================
This script will iterate over the output of the genius_validate script, and copy any of the songs w/ a 1 (meaning "correct Genius information was found") to a user-specified folder



genius_scraper_from_billboard.py
================================
This script will take in an .xlsx of song titles and artists (essentially, the first two columns of the output from the billboard_scraper.py script; each song, artist pair needs to have a unique ID in the third column, though!) and search Genius for each of them, saving a .json of the scraped data to disk. 



genius_scraper_from_msd.py
================================
This script is fairly similar to the genius_scraper_from_billboard.py script, except it's scraping some data that was extracted from the MSD dataset. I probably could have made both of these into one script that takes in more general lists - a problem for another day! 



genius_stats.py
===================
This script was written to get an idea of the distribution of some of the various attributes attached to the song .json's. A player passes the script a folder of Genius-scraped .json's, and this'll calculate various statistics about each attributes. (You can also specify *how many* of the .json's the script ought to sample for stats; this could save time if you have 100,000+ .json's) 



genius_validate.py
===================
This script takes in a folder of Genius .json's, as well as a list of the original song, artist pairs, and then uses some text-comparison algorithms (Levenshtein distance) to decide whether or not the song pulled from Genius is actually the song that we'd searched for. (Generally, there's an acceptance rate of ~65%, after certain text transformations - like removing parentheses - are made.) 



h5_to_xlsx_1.py and h5_to_xlsx_2.py 
===================================
These two scripts were used to extract data from the .h5 metadata file that contained metadata for the MSD. The 1st script seems to extract data from the metadata tab, whereas the second script extracts data from the analysis tab, and only for the songs which had years attached to them. 



spotify_audio_features_scraper.py
=================================
Runs through the URI's in spotify_uris.csv created from spotify_uri_scraper.py. These URI's come with the found song title and artist. If the found song title and artist are close enough (using various levenshtein distances) to the searched for song title and artist, then the URI is added to a batch. Each batch of URI's are sent to the Spotify API Audio Features endpoint. The JSON for the songs are updated with the audio features and saved to a new file.



spotify_non_found_uri_scraper.py
================================
This script runs through the spotify_uris.csv file created from the spotify_uri_scraper.py script. For any song where a URI was not found, it edits the title and artist to remove any non-word or non-space character before searching spotify again with it. The CSV file is updated with any newfound URIs.



spotify_uri_scraper.py
======================
This script runs through the songs from the "Genius Info - Billboard + MSD, 1990-2010.json" file and performs a search through the Spotify API to get the spotify URI for the track. The results from this search are stored in the spotify_uris.csv file. For each song, the file has the searched for title/artist, the found title/artist/uri, and whether it is a hit or not.
